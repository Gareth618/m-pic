# M-PIC ⛵

M-PIC is an aggregator-type app that helps you organize your photos from various photo-**sharing** platforms, such as facebook, instagram, twitter, reddit and unsplash

it was built by two students from their passion for quality **photography**, tired of wasting time by manually organizing their photos and sharing them on so many social platforms

M-PIC is the all-in-one platform you’ll ever need in order to save the time needed to organize your photo collection, letting you create more wonderful **memories** with your loved ones
