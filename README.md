# M-PIC â›µ

M-PIC is an aggregator-type app that helps you organize your photos from various photo-sharing platforms, such as facebook, instagram, twitter, reddit and unsplash

it was built by two students from their passion for quality photography, tired of wasting time by manually organizing their photos and sharing them on so many social platforms

M-PIC is the all-in-one platform youâ€™ll ever need in order to save the time needed to organize your photo collection, letting you create more wonderful memories with your loved ones
