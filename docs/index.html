        M-PIC is an aggregator-type app that helps users organize their photos from various photo-sharing platforms and social media apps such as Facebook, Twitter and Unsplash.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        M-PIC lets users manage their photos posted on various social media platforms as well as their comments, shares, likes and hashtags. A user could also upload photos from their device and M-PIC will automatically post them on the linked accounts. It is also possible to perform multi-criteria search on their photo collection and to apply filters before uploading.

        <h3>Home Page</h3>
        <p>
          The home page contains a sign-in form alongside a link to the sign-up page designed for users with no M-PIC account. The only fields the user must fill in order to access the app are email and password. They can also check whether they want the browser to keep them logged in. Under the form there is a brief description of the app that hightlights its main features.

      <section id="sign-up">
        <h3>Sign Up</h3>
        <p>
          The sign up page contains only a form that requires the users to provide their email address and a password in case they have no M-PIC account. If they already have an account, they can click the sign-in button and will be redirected to the home page where they can enter their credentials.

      <section id="my-photos">
        <h3>My Photos</h3>
        <p>
          After the user has managed to sign in, they are welcomed by the main page of the app, where all the photos the user has posted are displayed in a chronological order. Here it is possible to upload a new photo on the chosen social media platforms, search for certain photos based on the platforms they were posted on and sort them by the number of shares and likes. On the upper right corner of the page, there is a navigation button that has two options: either switch to the My Profiles page or sign out of the app.

      <section id="my-profiles">
        <h3>My Profiles</h3>
        <p>
          On this page, the user can see all the linked profiles and view or delete them. For every profile M-PIC displays three main social engagement indicators: number of posted photos, followers and total number of shares. The user can also add a new profile on a certain platform using the "+" sign in the lower left corner.

            The <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/FPE0X6J8mfUDaEQ6Sg8xH9/web">UI/UX mockup</a> of the app was designed in Figma. The frontend was written in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The backend is mainly built in PHP with the help of the APIs provided by the social media platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to use M-PIC, a user needs a stable connection to the internet and a browser. Thanks to the responsiveness of the app, M-PIC provides the best user experience possible, regardless of the screen size of the device used. The data exchange between the client and the server will be performed through a HTTPS protocol.
